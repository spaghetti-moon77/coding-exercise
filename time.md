# Time Breakdown

During this task I first decided to familiarise myself with what the functions were going to achieve and make sure that I understood each function's purpose.

Next I took a TDD approach to the task by implementing the PHPUnit tests with the desired outcomes using the example outcomes in the exercise instructions as a base so that I could run the tests as I went along to check if they were passing or failing.

Then I moved onto the functions but first took some time to design and plan how I was going to approach each function so that I had a basic plan to start with. I could then tweak as I went along to improve and fix any bugs that appeared or where my initial plan hadn't quite taken into account certain scenarios.

Once happy with the tests passing and adding several different scenarios to the tests, I then decided that I thought this would be a good fit for a console command given the simplicity of the arguments and so added commands for each function. I also added help and description properties to each one so these can also be viewed in the console to show a user how they should be used.
